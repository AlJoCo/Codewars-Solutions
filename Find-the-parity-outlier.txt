You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

def find_outlier(integers):
    storage1 = []
    storage2 = []
    for n in integers:
        if n % 2 == 0:
            storage1.append(n)
            if len(storage1) == 2:
                storage1.clear
        elif n % 2 == 1:
            storage2.append(n)
            if len(storage2) == 2:
                storage2.clear
    if len(storage1) == 1:
        return storage1[0]
    return storage2[0]
